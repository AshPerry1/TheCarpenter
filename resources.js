    verse: "Genesis 1:26-28",
    verseText: "Then God said, 'Let us make man in our image, after our likeness. And let them have dominion...' So God created man in his own image... And God blessed them. And God said to them, 'Be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth and subdue it.'",
    reflection: "Before sin entered the world, God gave Adam work to do—to cultivate the garden, to name the animals, to exercise dominion. Work is not a result of the Fall; it's a gift from God.

    verseText: "For you have died, and your life is hidden with Christ in God.",
    reflection: "You are not 'just' an accountant, teacher, or truck driver. You are a child of God, hidden with Christ, loved eternally. Your job is what you do, not who you are.

    reflection: "Your work is a stage for the gospel. Not because you preach at coworkers, but because your integrity, kindness, and excellence point to something greater. When people ask, 'Why do you work this way?' you get to tell them about Jesus. This week, let your work adorn the gospel.",
