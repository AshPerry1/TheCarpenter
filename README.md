# The Carpenter

> Helping every follower of Jesus see their everyday work as worship—because God sees it, and it matters forever.

## About

**The Carpenter** is a website that teaches the biblical doctrine of vocation: that all honest work done in faith matters to God and has eternal significance. Grounded in historic Protestant theology (PCA/Westminster Standards) and Scripture, the site helps Christians see their Monday-through-Friday jobs as acts of worship.

- **Doctrine of Vocation**: All lawful work done for God's glory has spiritual significance
- **Key Scriptures**:
  - Hebrews 6:10 — "God is not unjust so as to overlook your work..."
  - 1 Corinthians 15:58 — "Your labor in the Lord is not in vain"
