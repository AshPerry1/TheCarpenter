          <h2>Who We Are</h2>
          <p>We are young professionals who believe in Jesus Christ and have committed our lives to Him. While we're not pastors, preachers, or ministry leaders, we are believers who have wrestled with the same questions many people face: Does my daily work really matter to God? Do spreadsheets, reports, or small tasks count for eternity?</p>
          <p>Through our years as students and now as professionals, we've discovered that every ordinary task is an opportunity to glorify God. This truth has transformed how we view our work—and we want to share that transformation with you.</p>

  <!-- Why The Carpenter Section -->
  <section class="section-linen">
    <div class="container-sm">
      <h2>Why The Carpenter</h2>
      <p style="margin-top: 1.5rem;">Over time, we've learned that even the most ordinary tasks are opportunities to glorify God. Scripture says:</p>
      
      <div class="scripture-callout">
        <p class="scripture-text">"Whatever you do, work heartily, as for the Lord and not for men, knowing that from the Lord you will receive the inheritance as your reward. You are serving the Lord Christ."</p>
        <p class="scripture-ref">— Colossians 3:23–24 (ESV)</p>
      </div>

      <p>That means nothing in our lives is wasted — not the unseen details, not the frustrating moments, not even the jobs we think no one notices.</p>

      <div class="scripture-callout">
        <p class="scripture-text">"For God is not unjust so as to overlook your work and the love that you have shown for his name in serving the saints, as you still do."</p>
        <p class="scripture-ref">— Hebrews 6:10 (ESV)</p>
      </div>

      <p>Jesus Himself spent much of His earthly life working as a carpenter, and He understands the struggles, frustrations, and dignity of labor.</p>

      <div class="scripture-callout">
        <p class="scripture-text">"Is not this the carpenter, the son of Mary and brother of James and Joses and Judas and Simon? And are not his sisters here with us?"</p>
        <p class="scripture-ref">— Mark 6:3 (ESV)</p>
      </div>

      <p>This truth inspires <em>The Carpenter</em>: a site built to remind us that our work is seen, our calling matters, and that in Christ, our labor has eternal significance.</p>

      <div class="scripture-callout">
        <p class="scripture-text">"Therefore, my beloved brothers, be steadfast, immovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, knowing that in the Lord your labor is not in vain."</p>
        <p class="scripture-ref">— 1 Corinthians 15:58 (ESV)</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </section>

  <!-- Clarification & Invitation Section -->
  <section class="section-white">
    <div class="container-sm">
      <h2>A Calling, Not a Checklist</h2>
      <p style="margin-top: 1.5rem;">We don't see work as just a checklist anymore — we see it as a calling. Whether it's sitting in traffic, wrestling with spreadsheets, dealing with a tough boss, or walking through deep loss, God calls us to be excellent stewards of our time and gifts.</p>

      <div class="scripture-callout">
        <p class="scripture-text">"This is how one should regard us, as servants of Christ and stewards of the mysteries of God. Moreover, it is required of stewards that they be found faithful."</p>
        <p class="scripture-ref">— 1 Corinthians 4:2 (ESV)</p>
      </div>

      <p>Our hope for this site is simple: to spread the message that your everyday work is not mundane in God's eyes. You don't have to stand in a pulpit to make a difference. We are all missionaries in our workplaces, our homes, our classrooms, and our communities. Through this project, we want to provide resources that equip believers and seekers alike to see their jobs as worship and their lives as testimony to the goodness of God.</p>
